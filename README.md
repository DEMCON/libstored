# libstored - Store for Embedded Debugger

## How to build

Build out-of-tree:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	cmake --build .

By default, all examples are built.
For example, notice that sources are generated under `examples/1_hello`,
while the example itself is built in the `build` directory.
